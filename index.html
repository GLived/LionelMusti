                <h2>Who is Lionel Musti?</h2>
                <p>Lionel Musti is a nickname given to a 16 month old Jack Russell Terrier named Mustikas "Musti". She has always loved playing outside, and one day she found an old basketball lying around. 
                    Lacking opposable thumbs, she did what she does best now. Started dribbling the ball with her snoot and she's never looked back.</p>

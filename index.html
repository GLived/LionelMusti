                <h2>Who is Lionel Musti?</h2>
                <p>Lionel Musti is a nickname given to a 16 month old Jack Russell Terrier named Mustikas "Musti". She has always loved playing outside, and one day she found an old basketball lying around. <br>
                    Lacking opposable thumbs, she did what she does best now. Started dribbling the ball with her snoot and she's never looked back.</p>
